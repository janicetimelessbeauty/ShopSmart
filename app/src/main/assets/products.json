    "description": "The Best Noise Cancelling\nThe WF-1000XM5 reduces external noise over a wide bandwidth, from low to high frequencies. It contains two proprietary processors that cancel more external noise than ever, a new high-performance driver unit Dynamic Driver X, dual feedback microphones, and innovative Noise Isolation Earbud Tips for a more stable fit. Real-time noise-cancelling processing can be optimised to provide the best performance for your environment, so you will hear a big difference, especially in aeroplanes, trains, or buses.\nAstonishing sound quality\nThe specially designed driver unit Dynamic Driver X provides wide frequency reproduction, enabling deeper bass, subtle vocals and enhanced fine detail, especially on high-pitched instruments. The consummate performance, across the full range of frequencies, delivers a smooth and natural sound regardless of what you're listening to.\nSony‘s best ever call quality\nThanks to an AI-based noise reduction algorithm based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) processing, and bone conduction sensors, your voice will come through clear and natural, even in a noisy environment. And if you’re outdoors, the wind noise reduction structure will minimise any wind whooshes, so you always know you’ll be heard.\nSmall and beautifully designed\nWith an improved glossy texture and a more luxurious feel, these earbuds fit comfortably in your ears while keeping out external sounds. By downsizing the headphone body and optimising the placement of the components, the earbud is now approximately 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the WF-1000XM4. We’ve also reduced the size of the charging case, so it will sit even more sleeky in your pocket.\nSmooth switching\nFor total convenience, the WF-1000XM5 can be paired with two Bluetooth® devices simultaneously so, when a call comes in, your headphones can automatically connect to the right one. With the multipoint connection you can quickly switch to a ringing device, then back by simply resuming playback on the other device.\nAdjusts to the world around you\nAdaptive Sound Control senses where you are and what you’re doing, then uses AI to change ambient sound settings for the ideal listening experience. Over time, it will learn your behaviour, recognise locations you visit often, and tailor the sound to suit your location.\nTalk and hear only ambient sound\nYou can set Speak-to-Chat to pause the music as soon as you start speaking to someone, so you can hear just ambient sound and conduct a conversation – handy if you want to keep your headphones on or your hands are full. Once your chat is over, your music will start playing again automatically.\nWater resistant for everyday use\nWith an IPX4 water resistance rating, splashes and sweat won’t stop these headphones – so you can keep moving to the music.\nAiming to achieve a smaller footprint\nInspired by the beauty of the world, Sony is playing its part to help preserve the Earth. They are accelerating numerous initiatives to benefit the environment to achieve a zero environmental footprint across the entire Sony Group by the year 2050.\nKey Features\nThe Best Noise Cancelling* Headphones\nCompact and comfortable design\nHD Noise Cancelling Processor QN2e – blocks more noise, in more situations\nIntegrated Processor V2, for reliable connectivity and high-quality sound\nDynamic Driver X- deeper bass and better audio detail\nUp to 8 hours music per charge, or 24 hours when including the charging case\nQi® wireless and USB Type-C, with quick charge (3mins charge = 1 hour music)\nBe heard with Sony’s best ever call quality, via precise voice pickup technology\nSpeak-to-Chat mode, speak to pause your music- no button press required\nHeadtracking for immersive spatial audio and optional head-gesture control¹\nIPX4 rated - everyday protection from sweat and splashing water²\ncase is not water resistant\nWhat’s in the box?\nNoise isolation ear tips (4 sizes)\nUSB cable for charging\nReference guide\n*As of April 10, 2023.
