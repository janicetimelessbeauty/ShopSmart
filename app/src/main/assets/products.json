    "description": "The Best Noise Cancelling\nThe WF-1000XM5 reduces external noise over a wide bandwidth, from low to high frequencies. It contains two proprietary processors that cancel more external noise than ever, a new high-performance driver unit Dynamic Driver X, dual feedback microphones, and innovative Noise Isolation Earbud Tips for a more stable fit. Real-time noise-cancelling processing can be optimised to provide the best performance for your environment, so you will hear a big difference, especially in aeroplanes, trains, or buses.\nAstonishing sound quality\nThe specially designed driver unit Dynamic Driver X provides wide frequency reproduction, enabling deeper bass, subtle vocals and enhanced fine detail, especially on high-pitched instruments. The consummate performance, across the full range of frequencies, delivers a smooth and natural sound regardless of what you're listening to.\nSony‘s best ever call quality\nThanks to an AI-based noise reduction algorithm based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) processing, and bone conduction sensors, your voice will come through clear and natural, even in a noisy environment. And if you’re outdoors, the wind noise reduction structure will minimise any wind whooshes, so you always know you’ll be heard.\nSmall and beautifully designed\nWith an improved glossy texture and a more luxurious feel, these earbuds fit comfortably in your ears while keeping out external sounds. By downsizing the headphone body and optimising the placement of the components, the earbud is now approximately 25% smaller and 20% lighter than the WF-1000XM4. We’ve also reduced the size of the charging case, so it will sit even more sleeky in your pocket.\nSmooth switching\nFor total convenience, the WF-1000XM5 can be paired with two Bluetooth® devices simultaneously so, when a call comes in, your headphones can automatically connect to the right one. With the multipoint connection you can quickly switch to a ringing device, then back by simply resuming playback on the other device.\nAdjusts to the world around you\nAdaptive Sound Control senses where you are and what you’re doing, then uses AI to change ambient sound settings for the ideal listening experience. Over time, it will learn your behaviour, recognise locations you visit often, and tailor the sound to suit your location.\nTalk and hear only ambient sound\nYou can set Speak-to-Chat to pause the music as soon as you start speaking to someone, so you can hear just ambient sound and conduct a conversation – handy if you want to keep your headphones on or your hands are full. Once your chat is over, your music will start playing again automatically.\nWater resistant for everyday use\nWith an IPX4 water resistance rating, splashes and sweat won’t stop these headphones – so you can keep moving to the music.\nAiming to achieve a smaller footprint\nInspired by the beauty of the world, Sony is playing its part to help preserve the Earth. They are accelerating numerous initiatives to benefit the environment to achieve a zero environmental footprint across the entire Sony Group by the year 2050.\nKey Features\nThe Best Noise Cancelling* Headphones\nCompact and comfortable design\nHD Noise Cancelling Processor QN2e – blocks more noise, in more situations\nIntegrated Processor V2, for reliable connectivity and high-quality sound\nDynamic Driver X- deeper bass and better audio detail\nUp to 8 hours music per charge, or 24 hours when including the charging case\nQi® wireless and USB Type-C, with quick charge (3mins charge = 1 hour music)\nBe heard with Sony’s best ever call quality, via precise voice pickup technology\nSpeak-to-Chat mode, speak to pause your music- no button press required\nHeadtracking for immersive spatial audio and optional head-gesture control¹\nIPX4 rated - everyday protection from sweat and splashing water²\ncase is not water resistant\nWhat’s in the box?\nNoise isolation ear tips (4 sizes)\nUSB cable for charging\nReference guide\n*As of April 10, 2023.

    "description": "DJI Air 3 is a compact foldable drone with two powerful cameras—a wide-angle and a 3x medium telephoto. Enjoy optimized flights with a 46-minute max flight time, omnidirectional obstacle sensing, and O4 video transmission. Capture breathtaking details with dual-camera 48MP photos and 4K HDR video. With Air 3, film your subjects with unlimited creativity and tell a bold visual story.\n\nDual-Primary-Camera System\nAir 3 boasts the first dual-primary camera system of the Air series, embedding a 1/1.3-inch CMOS wide-angle camera and a 1/1.3-inch CMOS 3x medium tele camera in a sleek and compact body. The two cameras have the same sensor size but different focal lengths, delivering consistent image quality and more dynamic imaging possibilities.\n\nComplementary Camera Performance\nWith the wide-angle camera, sweeping landscapes can be more fully captured. And the 3x medium tele camera achieves lossless 3x optical zoom for spatial compression that provides a unique perspective of any subject.\n\nIconic from Every Angle\nUse the expansive FOV of the wide-angle camera to capture more of any landscape. Switch to the 3x medium tele camera to frame any subject as a bold focal point.\n\nDual-Camera 48MP Photos\nBoth cameras are capable of delivering 48MP photos filled with true-to-life details that look great and allow seamless cropping in post for those who need it.\n\nDual-Camera 4K/60fps HDR Videos\nAir 3’s two 1/1.3-inch CMOS sensors support dual native ISO for direct output of 4K/60fps HDR video without cropping. This means footage from either camera can be packed with rich coloring and natural lighting transitions for breathtaking and highly accurate results.\n\nBoth cameras also support 10-bit D-Log M and 10-bit HLG color modes. 10-bit D-Log M mode helps retain more highlight and shadow details for increased flexibility when editing, while 10-bit HLG mode can present a higher dynamic range, achieving excellent imaging results without color grading.\n\nExtended Flight, Innovative Charging\nAir 3 offers up to 46 minutes of flight time, an increase of 48% compared to the previous generation. This provides plenty of time to explore, adjust compositions, and get the shots you want, all during a single flight.\n\nThe new battery charging hub supports an innovative power transfer function. Simply press and hold the function button to transfer the remaining power from multiple batteries to the battery with the highest remaining power, giving you a more fully charged battery in situations where charging options are limited.\n\nOmnidirectional Obstacle Sensing\nAn omnidirectional sensing system enables comprehensive environmental awareness, allowing Air 3 to detect obstacles in all directions. When obstacles are detected, Air 3 can use APAS 5.0 to perform smoother avoidance movements for a safer overall flight experience. Even complete beginners can now fly with confidence and execute creative ideas with enhanced safety.\n\nO4 Video Transmission\nThe next-gen O4 video transmission system empowers Air 3 with dramatically enhanced transmission performance. It provides a max range of 20 km with increased stability, and a 1080p/60fps max-quality live feed to ensure ultra-smooth viewing and operating.\n\nAdvanced RTH\nDuring Smart RTH, Air 3 will automatically plan an optimized flight route for Advanced RTH, while maintaining omnidirectional obstacle sensing to return to its home point quickly and safely.\n\nEffortlessly Cutting-Edge\nFocusTrack keeps you or your subject easily in the center of the frame. The 3x medium tele camera unlocks a unique sense of spatial compression when highlighting subjects. This updated tracking performance combined with omnidirectional obstacle sensing lets you get intelligent, well-planned shots whenever and wherever you need them.\n\nQuickShots empower Air 3 with creative camera movement options like Rocket, Dronie, Circle, Helix, Boomerang, and Asteroid.\n\n2.7K Vertical Shooting\nAir 3 supports 2.7K vertical shooting with both cameras, giving vertical footage a superbly dynamic look when capturing landscapes or subjects. The 2.7K vertical shot output directly from the 4:3 CMOS delivers clips that are optimized for smartphone viewing and ready to share on social media without any cropping needed in post.\n\nMasterShots\nMasterShots allows Air 3 to automatically perform diverse camera movements, shooting multiple clips and editing them with music, cuts, and effects for fast and simplified cinematic footage.\n\nHyper-Advanced Shooting\nWaypoint\nFor the first time ever, the Waypoint feature is now available on the Air series. Plan flight routes and shooting actions for Air 3 in advance to achieve difficult camera movements and stunning one-takes.
